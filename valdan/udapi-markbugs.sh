# Udapi depends on a few Python modules that may not be installed system-wide.
# If we followed the instructions in Udapi's README, pip3 installed the modules
# into our home: ~/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages. However, user www-data
# will not find the packages there. Hence we assume that ~/.local/lib/python3.4
# has been recursively copied to the current folder as pythonlib.
export PYTHONPATH=pythonlib/site-packages

# Finally, we assume that Udapi itself also exists (as a clone of the Github
# repository) in the current folder, in a subfolder named udapi-python. We will
# now call it and let it take care of our STDIN and STDOUT.

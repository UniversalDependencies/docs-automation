  <h1>Specify auxiliaries for English</h1>
  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Not everything that a traditional grammar labels as auxiliary is necessarily an <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/AUX_.html">auxiliary in UD</a>. Just because a verb combines with another verb does not necessarily mean that one of the verbs is auxiliary; the usual alternative in UD is treating one of the verbs as an <tt><a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/xcomp.html">xcomp</a></tt> of the other. Language-specific tests whether a verb is auxiliary are grammatical rather than semantic: just because something has a modal or near-modal meaning does not mean that it is an auxiliary, and in some languages modal verbs do not count as auxiliaries at all. Some verbs function as auxiliaries in some constructions and as full verbs in others (e.g., <i>to have</i> in English). There are also auxiliaries whose nature is completely different from verbs in the given language.</p>
